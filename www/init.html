                <h2>What is a solar flare or geomagnetic storm?</h2>
                <p>
                    A solar flare or geomagnetic storm is a disruption of Earth's magnetic field caused by the interaction between the planet's magnetosphere and solar wind or coronal mass ejections. Solar storms, which include solar flares, solar wind, and coronal mass ejections, are sudden releases of energy from the Sun's atmosphere. These events are part of the solar cycle, a repeating 11-year process where the Sun’s magnetic poles flip. The Aurora Borealis (northern lights) occurs when solar particles collide with Earth's atmosphere, creating colorful displays. The biggest recorded solar storm, the Carrington Event of 1859, caused global disruptions, and a powerful solar storm in May 2024, classified as G5, had significant impacts on communication systems and GPS.

                    <p>
                    Solar storms are events that occur in The sun’s atmosphere, characterized by the sudden release of energy. This energy is released in several ways including: Solar flares, solar wind and Coronal mass ejections.

                        A solar cycle lasts eleven years and this process repeats. The purpose of this cycle is to complete the sun’s magnetic cycle. This means that the sun's North and south poles change places.

                The northern lights, or auroras, are a natural phenomenon that occurs when protons and electrons released by the sun collide with the atmosphere. This causes energy changes that generate lights in the sky. They are seen more frequently near the poles because the Earth's poles attract these particles. Their frequency depends on how active the sun is.

                        <p>
                            We see auroras for a massive count of particles flowing across the magnetic field and there the particles with gasses in our atmosphere resulting in different colors, like purple, green, pink, red and blue. And these colors are associated with a massive energy released by the sun.

The solar flares were so intense that it was possible to read without the need for artificial light at midnight.

                <p>
                  In May, the sun produced its largest solar storm in 20 years. It was so powerful that the northern lights were even visible in Mexico. This storm was classified as G5 and was caused by a cluster of sunspots 16 times larger than Earth, which expelled material every 6 hours.
                  What were its consequences?
                  It affected radio transmissions, telephone companies suspended their services to prevent serious damage, GPS-dependent systems failed, and it caused interference with compasses.
